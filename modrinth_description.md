# Skyblock Render Enhanced (SRE)

Skyblock Render Enhanced (SRE) is a lightweight Fabric mod for Hypixel Skyblock that hides all players except the ones you choose. It is designed for crowded areas such as hub lobbies, foraging islands, slayer locations, and end lobbies where too many players can cause visual clutter.
